Logged off. Focused on healing.\n\nAnd now, step by step - I’m finding my way back.\nNot rushing. Just rebuilding - slowly and mindfully.\n\nTo everyone who checked in: thank you.\nTo everyone else navigating tough times: I see you. Take your time. Healing isn’t a race.\n\nI’m recovering.\nSlowly. Gently. One day at a time.\n\nTrying to find my rhythm again - without burning myself out.\n\nIf you’re going through something right now - whether it’s physical, mental, emotional -\n\nPlease know: it’s okay to pause.\n - It’s okay to fall behind.\n - It’s okay to not be okay.\n\nYou owe no one an explanation for choosing your peace.\nI’m still in that space - of reflection, realignment, and rebuilding.\n\nI’m coming back - one little step at a time.",
